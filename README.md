🔥 Day 13: Web Development Practice - Bat Ball Stump Game! 🎮🏏
Today, I built an interactive Bat Ball Stump Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game works just like Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with a cricket twist! 🏏💡
✨ Features:
 ✅ Simple and engaging UI 🎨
 ✅ Randomized computer moves 🤖

Try it out and see if you can beat the computer! Let’s make learning web development fun and interactive. 😃
